# DarkRP 

Roleplay Gamemode for S&Box.

Many people have offered their help via Discord and other means. I thank you all for that. Consequently, I have decided to open this repository so that together we can accomplish this ambitious project, let's make DarkRP S&Box a thing !

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECT 

I recommend using the Github Desktop application, which greatly simplifies the work. Then you can submit pull requests to this repository, and I will take care of reviewing them. If you have any game development skills that could help the project, you are welcome here !

## A FEW SMALL RULES TO FOLLOW

- If possible, use simple and easy-to-understand code, and make sure to comment it to facilitate the work for everyone.
- Overall, try to keep the file sizes as small as possible.
- Please use as much validity and null check to keep the game error rate as low as possible.
- Feel free to add yourself to the credits; just specify what you contributed to the project.
