# Linux Fix

The game view is broken on Linux, lets fix that with a simple library!

## How to use?

Just add the library to your current project. Once you do that reset and you should have a cake button on the left. Click the button and the game view should be fixed!

## Why is this needed?

Currently the way the game view works is broken under proton. Without this patch, the game view barely works, renders incorrectly and doesn't accept input half the time.
