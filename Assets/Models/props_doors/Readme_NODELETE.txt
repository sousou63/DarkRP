Any building model such as doors or windows should specify what size they are, e.g.:
- models/props_doors/temp_door_001a_44_92

The two numbers _x_x is to show at a glance it is 44 units wide and 92 tall.
This informs mappers what size hole is required to fit the model or prefab.

When placing prefabs please use the model with the frame, if extra versions with alternative textures are used just change lettering, e.g.: 001a_44_92, 001b_44_92, 001c_44_92

Second note: All Source walls are usually either 8 units or 16 units wide, this format current doesn't specify so may need to be changed later.
